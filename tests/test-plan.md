# Epi regression test plan

## Scope and execution

This is the canonical automated console test plan for Epi, **C-Sort**, and **A-MoreErrorHandling**. `sort date` displays tasks chronologically, preserving full-list numbers and stored order. No aliases, natural dates, editing, duplicate rejection, or new storage format are included.

Run from the project root with Java 25 configured:

```text
powershell -NoProfile -File .codex/skills/test-ui/scripts/run_ui_tests.ps1
```

The runner asks Gradle to compile the app and supply the complete runtime classpath. Each case runs `epi.Epi` in a fresh process and its own temporary working directory, so the default `data/epi.txt` cannot refer to the user's file or a previous case's file. All inputs below use fixed dates, and test JVMs use an English (US) locale; no production clock or locale behavior is changed.

The expected output for each case is the shared startup output followed by its complete expected response. Comparisons are case-sensitive and ignore only trailing whitespace and platform line-ending differences. Extra, missing, or reordered response lines fail. Empty input blocks mean EOF without a command; otherwise the runner closes stdin after submitting the listed lines. The process must exit successfully with no stderr within 15 seconds by default.

On the first failure, stop, show the actual and expected output, and retain the failed run's temporary files. Successful run directories are removed. Every run records the console input/output at `build/reports/ui-tests/transcript.txt` (the latest run replaces that report).

## JUnit coverage

Maintain the project's approximately 50% highest-value-method target, prioritizing core behavior rather than a line-coverage percentage. After relevant changes, update the tests and this plan, then run Gradle `test checkstyleMain checkstyleTest` and the console runner.

- `EpiTest`: full command responses, task numbering, validation without mutation, read-only commands, and reload after add/mark/unmark/delete. Repeated mark/unmark tests cover all task types, informational replies, unchanged file contents/modification time, and no save attempts when storage is unavailable. C-Sort tests check exact replies, original numbers for subsequent mutations, unchanged file contents/modification time, invalid arguments, and sorting after reload.
- `StorageTest`: existing records, round trips, UTF-8 text, paths with spaces, missing files, damaged records/encoding, unusable paths, external edits, and preservation after failed saves. Access-denied and unsupported atomic moves are injected deterministically, without changing real permissions. Every file lives under JUnit `@TempDir`.
- `ParserTest`: whitespace, case-insensitive markers, missing/repeated/wrong-order fields, and task-number boundaries/overflow.
- `DeadlineTest` and `EventTest`: impossible dates, leap-year boundaries, invalid clock times, and equal/reversed event endpoints; valid overnight and one-minute events remain accepted.
- `TaskListTest` and `TaskTest`: collection/order/search/status tests, plus date sorting across years/times/types, event-start ordering, stable ties, completed/undated tasks, empty/single lists, and a structurally independent sorted copy.
- `DialogBoxTest`: responsive bot/user content widths, initial/tiny layout widths, expansion beyond the old fixed limit, and centred square crops for portrait/landscape/square/fractional image sizes.

Cases 1-17 cover basic commands and chronological sorting; case 8 now checks explicit no-match feedback. Cases 18-21 protect stricter validation and recovery after rejected commands. `EpiTest` also verifies that every mutating command rolls back on failed saves, startup recovery blocks writes, and error classification does not depend on message text. `TaskListTest` checks independent snapshots, including completion flags, so failed status changes cannot leak into live tasks. See [gui-test-plan.md](gui-test-plan.md) for visible file warnings and the separate JavaFX scene/manual checks. File fixtures belong in JUnit and the isolated GUI smoke runner; the console cases below always start with a fresh empty file.

Case 22 checks repeated mark/unmark feedback and unchanged task status. `TaskTest` also verifies the completion-state getter before and after repeated status changes.

Case 23 checks searching an empty list, missing-keyword validation, and successful search after adding a task. `EpiTest` verifies that no-match searches are informational, preserve the keyword's case, and do not alter task data or the file's modification time.

```text
Purr! There is no task in your list
Meow for now. See you later!
```

## Test case 14: Sort mixed tasks and keep full-list numbers

### Aim

Verify chronological ordering (including a year boundary), completed tasks, event starts rather than ends, stable ties and Todo ordering. Then verify that list, mark, and delete still use the original full-list order and numbers.

### Input

```text
todo notes
deadline report /by 2019-12-02 1800
event meeting /from 2019-12-01 1400 /to 2019-12-03 1600

## Test case 15: Sort an empty list and reject unsupported arguments

### Aim

Verify the empty-list response and usage guidance for missing, unknown, or extra sort arguments, without changing any tasks.

### Input

```text
sort date
sort
sort name
sort date desc
todo notes
sort /order desc
list
bye
```

### Expected output

```text
Purr! There is no task in your list
Meow! Use: sort date

Meow! Use: sort date
More work? Fine. I have added this task:
[T][ ] notes
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
Meow! Use: sort date
Here is your pile of tasks:
1. [T][ ] notes
Meow for now. See you later!
```

## Test case 16: Sort only undated tasks using mixed-case keywords

### Aim

Verify existing command whitespace handling, the case-insensitive date keyword, and stable Todo ordering regardless of description or completion status.

### Input

```text
todo zebra notes
todo apple notes
mark 2
  SoRt   DaTe
list
bye
```

### Expected output

```text
More work? Fine. I have added this task:

Meow for now. See you later!
```

## Test case 17: Sort a single task and identical dated tasks

### Aim

Verify single-task sorting, distinct full-list numbers for identical tasks, and repeatable results without mutating ordinary list order. Duplicate detection is not part of C-Sort.

### Input

```text
deadline book /by 2019-12-02 1800
sort date

```

## Test case 18: Accept whitespace and parameter case without altering descriptions

### Aim

Verify leading spaces, multiple separating spaces, case-insensitive markers, preserved internal description spaces, and valid leap-day dates. JUnit also covers trailing spaces and tabs.

### Input

```text
  DeAdLiNe   Read  Book   /BY   2020-02-29   1200
  EVENT  night  shift  /FROM  2020-02-29  2359  /TO  2020-03-01  0000

Meow for now. See you later!
```

## Test case 19: Reject impossible dates and non-positive event durations

### Aim

Verify that invalid dates/times are rejected rather than silently normalized, and that no invalid event or deadline is added. A later valid command must still work.

### Input

```text
deadline book /by 2019-02-29 1200
deadline book /by 2020-02-30 1200
deadline book /by 2020-04-31 1200

1. [T][ ] recovery works
Meow for now. See you later!
```

## Test case 20: Reject malformed fields and unsafe descriptions

### Aim

Verify missing/repeated/wrong-order parameters, empty descriptions/date fields, and pipe characters cannot produce partial tasks or corrupt records. Ordinary punctuation stays allowed.

### Input

```text
deadline book
deadline /by 2020-01-01 1200
deadline book /by
deadline book /by 2020-01-01 1200 /by 2020-01-02 1200

```

## Test case 21: Reject extra arguments and task-number overflow without exiting

### Aim

Verify malformed bye does not terminate the CLI, list rejects extra text, and extreme/multiple/nonnumeric task numbers leave the task unchanged. A valid spaced bye must still exit.

### Input

```text
todo keep me
bye extra
list extra
mark -2147483648
delete 2147483647
unmark 99999999999999999999

todo must not run
```

### Expected output

```text
More work? Fine. I have added this task:
[T][ ] keep me
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
Meow! Use: bye
Meow! Use: list
That task number doesn't exist in my memory!
That task number doesn't exist in my memory!
That is not a valid number

That is not a valid number
Here is your pile of tasks:
1. [T][ ] keep me
Meow for now. See you later!
```

## Test case 22: Report already marked or unmarked tasks

### Aim

Verify that repeated mark/unmark commands report the current status instead of claiming a change, while real transitions retain their existing confirmations. Also check mixed-case command names and separating spaces.

### Input

```text
todo read book
unmark 1
unmark 1
mark 1
  MaRk   1
mark 1
list
unmark 1
  UnMaRk   1
list
bye
```

### Expected output

```text
More work? Fine. I have added this task:
[T][ ] read book
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
Meow! Task 1 is already marked as not done.
[T][ ] read book
Meow! Task 1 is already marked as not done.
[T][ ] read book
About time you finished something. I've marked it as done:
[T][X] read book
Purr! Task 1 is already marked as done.
[T][X] read book
Purr! Task 1 is already marked as done.
[T][X] read book
Here is your pile of tasks:
1. [T][X] read book
Slacking off, are we? I've marked this as not done:
[T][ ] read book
Meow! Task 1 is already marked as not done.
[T][ ] read book
Here is your pile of tasks:
1. [T][ ] read book
Meow for now. See you later!
```

## Test case 23: Search an empty list and distinguish a missing keyword

### Aim

Verify that searching an empty list reports no matches and preserves the supplied keyword's case. A missing keyword must still show validation guidance, and adding a task must allow a later partial search to succeed.

### Input

```text
find Movie night
find
todo read book
  FiNd   BOO
bye
```

### Expected output

```text
Meow! I couldn't find any tasks matching "Movie night".
Please provide a keyword to search for.
More work? Fine. I have added this task:
[T][ ] read book
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
